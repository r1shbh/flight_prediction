## Hackathon: Predicting Flight Prices
Hackathon hosted on MachineHack website for the prediction of flight.
### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `flight_prediction.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included file `Data_Train.csv` dataset file to build the model. While, 'Test_set.csv' is used to evaluate the submission.


This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
